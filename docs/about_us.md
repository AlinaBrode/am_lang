Hello everyone!

Let me bump this thread. I'm trying to build a friendly place in the Internet for expats in Armenia.

Lang tools is a place where you can find exercises to master Armenian alphabet, to get accustomed with frequent phrases and words. Also my wife and I are publishing short story about life in Yerevan from the expat's perspective.

We have a mirror of the site in Telegram. So far it is in Russian. But we can communicate in English and if there is a demand, we can make English clone of the resource.
