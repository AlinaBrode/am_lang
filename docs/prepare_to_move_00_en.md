# Moving to Yerevan. Part 1

Let's go back to 2023 when we prepared to move. This is the first post of the series.

The first question was where to go. To stay close to relatives we considered only visa-free countries. The first candidate was Serbia.
We read channels and articles, exchanged euros, estimated monthly expenses, looked at school options. A sad finding: in winter the air pollution index on iqair.com goes off the scale. In Yerevan it isn't perfect either, but more about that later. We planned to visit Moscow a couple of times a year, and the price of a direct Moscow–Belgrade flight—230 thousand rubles—made this plan unrealistic. For Armenia the price is about 75–100 thousand rubles for three adults, with many direct flights of Russian airlines (Aeroflot, UTair, Ural Airlines etc.) and Armenian ones—ShirakAvia, FlyOne Armenia. The final step before choosing Armenia was to find a school. We searched via channels t.me/ru_schools_armenia and t.me/erevanmoms.

Here is our relocation checklist
* **power of attorney for a close relative**

  Needed to represent your interests in organizations. If you plan to rent out your apartment, mention this as a separate item.

* **withdraw cash rubles for exchange in Armenia**

  Russian bank cards are not accepted for payment, so you need cash. The best dram/ruble rate is in SAS exchange offices—a department store chain in Yerevan. You can track favorable rates in Telegram channels, e.g. t.me/armeniaCurrency

* **obtain a residence permit or plan visa runs**

  A non-resident may stay in Armenia for 180 days; afterward a visa run is required. Our residence permit was arranged by an employer. A child under 18 can stay in Armenia without crossing the border every six months.

* **choose a school**

  School selection will be covered in a separate post

* **choose an apartment**

   Armenian channels offer many rental options; there is list.am where in the long-term rental section one can pick an apartment. The downside of this site is many fake listings from realtors. We used a realtor recommended by friends.

* **rent out your apartment**

To rent out our Moscow flat we used Yandex.Rent. You don't have to meet the tenant; you choose one via an application form. There's a contract. The downside is that it's harder to rent out. For tenants the service adds a 7% monthly commission to the rent, making it more expensive.

* **set up essential services**

Download necessary apps—banking, Gosuslugi, mos.ru, the taxpayer's cabinet. All apps work via VPN.

* **check for outstanding debts: unpaid fines, child support...**

Otherwise you may not be allowed to leave the country
