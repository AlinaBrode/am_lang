# Sevan. Part 1

Our spontaneous trip turned out to be very rich and memorable for just one and a half days. Step by step. Today we talk about the hotel where we stayed — [Tsovasar Family Rest Complex](https://yandex.com/maps/-/CLUAI68s).

We booked a room with a kitchen-living room, bedroom and a balcony overlooking Sevan. The weather at the lake is very pleasant at this time: sunny and calm during the day, air temperature 20–22 °C and water about 19 °C. Impressions of the hotel:
* Friendly staff.
* Nice grounds with an equipped descent into the lake and a small beach.
* Tasty breakfasts (omelet, cheeses, rolls, sausages, pancakes, cottage cheese, yogurt). There is a choice, everything is fresh and delicious.

You can have lunch or dinner at the restaurant. The menu is tasty and varied, mostly Armenian cuisine. A full dinner for three cost us 20 000 drams including service.

The area has many gazebos, benches and lounge areas. There is also a place to barbecue. Price: 36 000 drams per night. In our opinion the price matches the quality.

Since our channel is also about the Armenian language, let's look at the word Ծովասար (Tsovasar). It consists of two parts: Ծով (tsov) → “sea” and սար (sar) → “mountain.” Altogether it means “sea mountain.”
