# Pros and cons of life in Yerevan. Part 1

After two years of living in Armenia, in Yerevan, we put together a list of pros and cons that may help anyone considering Yerevan as a place to live. A small disclaimer: for us the pros still outweigh any cons—we love Yerevan as it is, cozy and homely.

So, the pros:

**Openness and friendliness of locals.** People create the atmosphere of a place, and here they are wonderful: open and kind, ready to help.

**Antiquity and uniqueness.** Yerevan is more than 2,800 years old. Antiquity permeates the city and its surroundings: ancient monasteries and fortresses, the heritage of the kingdom of Urartu, winemaking, many interesting personalities who contributed not only to Armenian but also to world history. Yerevan and Armenia are like a rich full-bodied wine whose flavor reveals itself gradually.

**Warm and dry climate.** The weather in Yerevan is very pleasant: we extend summer by three months—May is already a summer month, and until November temperatures can reach 20°C. The heat is tolerable thanks to the dry climate and the convenient layout of the center: when walking, you can always stay on the shady side.

**Fruits and vegetables.** Excellent quality, and you can always find options for any budget. We prefer buying at vegetable stalls near our home. Out of season, imported fruit from Iran is of decent quality. In season, prices for fruit and vegetables are low.

**Cheap taxis.** We mostly walk around Yerevan because we love long strolls, or we use taxis. They are affordable even during rush hour. For example, from our Arabkir district to the center at rush hour you can get there for about 1,200 drams (~300 rubles).
